/**
 * 
 * @author luckson
 *
 * The Description class archetype that models a catalog-entry-like description. 
 * It is a collection of values that apply again and again. 
 * It also provides behavior across the collection of all things that correspond to its description. [Coad99].
 * Examples include classes representing product descriptions of all kinds. 
 * The difference between a blue and green is the difference between a film and the DVD's on which the film is recorded.
 * Description classes are pastel blue in color. Description classes categorize or label other stuff depending on different values,
 *  typically objects of Party, Place, Thing classes but occasionally Moment-Intervals too. 
 *  The industries that companies work within are objects of a Description class. 
 *  The models of a car in a show room are objects of a Description class. 
 * The titles of books sold by Amazon.com are objects of a Description class.
 * The labels you use to catalog stuff like this, are always blue!
